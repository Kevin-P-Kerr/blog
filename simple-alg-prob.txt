Let's construct a simple algebra of probabilites.

First, let's define a set Confidence = {C,V,S,I} where
C = certain
V = very
S = somewhat
I = indifferent

Then define a set L = {Cx"-"}, so we can get lack of confidence.

Then define addition and multiplication on L.  

First, we define addition. 

C is the unit of addition.  Then, every element of L has an inverse, namely

forall x:L, x+-x=C.

However, we don't allow for addition of "positive" probabilities.  + in LxL is injective, but not bijective.

Additionally, -I = I.

So, 

V = -S+-S 
S = -V+-V
I = -V+-S

Then to multiply elements, we use this table

C  V  S  I
V  S  I  -S
S  I  -S -V
I  -S -V  -V
