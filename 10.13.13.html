		</h2>
		<p>
			I've been dismayed to discover just how many software developers aren't really completely up to speed on the mysterious world of character sets, encodings, Unicode, all that stuff...[Most programmers wish] it would all blowever somehow. <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode/" target="_blank"> Continue Reading ...</a>

		</h2>
		<p> The incredible numbers in yesterday’s NBC/WSJ poll pretty much demonstrate that point: approval of the Republican party is at an all-time low…and 60% of voters would vote out every single member of Congress at once including their own if given the chance.
		</p>
		<p> Today I start to outline a true prediction. I give a “toy model,” i.e. step 1 toward something more realistic. The toy model relies on a prediction of popular vote only.
		</p>
		<p>
		Provisionally, it looks like the following: In a little over a week, the shutdown has increased the probability of a Democratic House takeover in 2014 from 13% to as high as 50%.
		</p>
		<p> the shutdown, combined with the fluidity of gerrymandered districts, has added a highly unexpected twist. The 50% figure could swing back toward the Republicans, or it could go further toward the Democrats.
