Reading the New Testament, Part III

Questions of Prophecy in Matthew 2.

Another thing that strikes me in Matthew is the use of prophecy.

The New Testament writers, and their sub-apostolic progeny were obsessed with prophecy.  We can't really understand the new testament or reckon with it fully unless we try to seriously grapple with why that may be so.  

At least for me, I tend to glaze right over this material.  It seems to me obviously apologetic--unfalisifiable nonsense.  But we can accept the first part of the judgement--no one can seriously dispute that the prophetic testimonia in the new testament is inserted for apologetic purposes--while rejecting the second.  If many of the testimonia appear to be cryptic utterances ripped from their context and historical time, then we are doing a similar injustice to the early evangelists who used that material, for they certainly did not have a concept of our regime of scientific production of knowledge.  The question is, what was the apologetic purpose of the testimonia?
