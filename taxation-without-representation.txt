Thinking about taxation without representation.

Reading this article in the nyt (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/opinion/sunday/why-blue-states-are-the-real-tea-party.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-left-region&region=opinion-c-col-left-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-left-region&_r=0) got me thinking.

Take this provocative quote: 
This was always a betrayal of one-person-one-vote equality, in that a voter in rural Wyoming has more than three times the power of a voter in New Jersey, the country’s most densely populated state. But those imbalances have become far more glaring, thanks to a filter bubble more pronounced than anything on Facebook: the “big sort” that has concentrated Democrats in cities and inner-ring suburbs, and Republicans in exurbs and rural counties.

That is, as our cities have gotten bigger and more blue, their residents have found themselves more taxed and less represented.  

This raises some interesting questions.

1) Is this true?  That is, do urban voters have lower net tax outlays and less voting power now than they did in, say, 1940?  
2) Is it just when less efficiently distributed communities have less voting power.

For the first question, we can actually arrive at an answer.

First, derive a "political representation" score--say avg(urban cong. dist. size)/avg(congressional district size).  
Then, derive an idea of the average net federal tax outlay per urban area.  

Then see if these two scores move in relation to one another.  That would indicate if urban areas were taxed more with less representation.
